    <br>
    <p >Our story started in 2019 I guess . I was the one who sent you the follow request, 
        and luckily you followed me back. Jab mai mumma ke phone par insta chalata tha  &#128514;	&#128514;.
        So, hum baat karne lage and one random day you called me you said hello and I said hello,fir tune kaha 
        ki meri awaaz meri shakal se match nhi karti wtf bro?? seriously?	&#128514;	&#128514; Then we started talking and dheere dheere we became good friends.
        Tu sab share karne laga and I made another account and added you on it, iI used to post random shit on it and you used to comment on all of them.
        we grew closer during lockdown and you became my happy place  , i loved talking to you and you kinda helped me get through my tough times. Lock down khatam hua but humaari dosti nhi, we grew even closer . Tere exams aare the you were so stressed , i still remember 
        you calling me when you feel low ,crying  and i loved making you feel happy. Finally you scored good in 10th I was so happy and I warned about
        all the things that went wrong in my life , I thought you would learn from my mistakes and maybe you did. You committed some of your own mistakes and you learned from them. But we drifted apart during the late 2022. I remember telling you not to leave me on seen ais kuch hua tha but you did and i blocked you lol. i waited for you for days weeks months but tune contact ni kiya hehe. I thought ive lost you forever,
        kabhi kabhi I used to stalk you and i found out ki you were in a relationship and i was so happy for you for real but kinda sad bcos you were not in my life, i still remember ki tu apne birthday par merko call karega 
        and gaali deke bolega ki wish ni kiya but its okay... Around my birthday i want talking to any of my close friends  i missed them but i missed you the most , tab bhi i hoped ki tu text karega lekin nhi kiya , i was sad but koi na. Dheere Dheere time passed and i accepted the fact ki abb ye wapas nhi aayegi but one random day out of nowhere i saw your view on my story 
        and i cant tell you kitna khush tha mai, had se zyada but i was also mad at you , tune request bheji fir text kiya i was still mad, but somehow you made me forget the anger , i was happy again ,for real baby you have a big influence on my life and my happines just by being in it. We came closer again baat honi shuru ho gayi dobara ladko ke baare mai batana shuru kar diya hehe, hum normal ho gaye then one random day you confessed your feelings for me i was so happy and confused but more happy.
        thoda time laga merko process krne mai but i accepted the fact ki i had feelings for and they are growing ever since.
        <b>BABY YOU MEAN THE WORLD TO ME</b> and no amount of words could express that . Just thankyou for existing and taking care for me , youve  helped in a lot of ways. 
     I met you in my i dont need a girl phase and now i literally cant go 10 minutes without you you made me belive in love again thanyou so much baby.&#10084;&#65039;
