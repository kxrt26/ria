            Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
            She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
            I found a lover, to carry more than just my secrets
            To carry love, to carry children of our own

            Cause you make me
            Feel like I'm livin' a teenage dream
            The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
            Let's run away and don't ever look back
            Ever look back, oh
            My heart stops when you look at me
            Just one touch, now baby, I believe
            This is real
            So take a chance and don't ever look back
            Ever look back, oh
